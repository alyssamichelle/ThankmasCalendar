# ThankmasCalendar
A Blazor app in .NET 6 for the CodeItLive Thankmas Stream 2021

This holiday calendar was inspired by Ed's dorm in college with gingerbread walls that some of the fraternity brothers would take it upon themselves 
to enjoy.

We hope you enjoy checking out and tinkering with the source code to our fun little app.
